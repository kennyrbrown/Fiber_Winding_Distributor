This fiber winding distributor was designed to distribute fibers spun on the Li Lab melt spinning line along the windup spool used to take up the spun fibers. This system is agnostic to the specifications of the spool and can be used for any device that involves moving something back and forth between two limit switches with controls for speed and on/off stage.
